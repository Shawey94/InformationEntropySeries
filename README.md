# Information Entropy Meets Artificial Intelligence
This repository will include the code and experimental setup details for the paper "Exploring the impact of information entropy change in learning systems" across various learning applications, including classification, domain adaptation, domain generalization, semi-supervised learning, etc.

[09/29/2023] Semi-supervised learning (SSL) work is currently in progress. Excited to extend the proposed theory for SSL and more.

[08/21/2023] As requested by a reviewer, we conducted tests on ImageNetV2 and achieved a top-1 accuracy of 84.8% (using LinearQ). 

[04/12/2023] Achieved a top 1 accuracy of 95.38% (OptimalQ) on ImageNet-1K with pre-trained weights on ImageNet-21K.

Research, coding, analysis, and maintenance are all on my own, so quite busy usually. Updates will be made periodically.
